Be yourself; everyone else is already taken
You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth
Be the change that you wish to see in the world
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever
We accept the love we think we deserve
We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will
Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you
Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right
Happiness is not something readymade. It comes from your own actions
